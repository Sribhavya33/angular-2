# angular-2
I created simple application using angular2 and type script
So for this we need NPM to be installed the command to install is 'npm install'
You can use any of the text editors that support typescript such as 'Atom', 'Visual studio code' etc
Once you export all the code in the text editor you can run npm start in the command prompt. Once it is executed it is automatically opened in the browser

So I am attaching some of the links for your reference to download text editors or npm and to know morw about angular 2
