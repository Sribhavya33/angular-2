        Welcome to angular 2 home page
         <p>Angular applications are made up of components.<br>
             A component is the combination of an HTML template and a component class that controls a portion of the screen.
             very component begins with an @Component decorator function that takes a metadata object. <br>
             The metadata object describes how the HTML template and component class work together.<br>

The selector property tells Angular to display the component inside a custom my-app tag in the index.html.
